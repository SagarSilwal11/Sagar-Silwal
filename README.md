## Hi, I'm Sagar  👋

I am a Computer Science and Information Technology graduate with a strong interest in data analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and backend development. I enjoy working with data to uncover insights, building intelligent models, and developing applications that connect analytical logic with real-world use cases.

My academic and project experience has helped me develop a solid foundation in data-driven problem solving, where I focus on understanding data behavior, selecting appropriate models, and implementing solutions in a practical and structured way. I am particularly curious about emerging areas such as deep learning and generative AI, and I actively explore how these technologies can be applied responsibly and effectively.
